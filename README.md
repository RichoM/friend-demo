# Among Friends

…a collection of demonstration apps using
[Friend](http://github.com/cemerick/friend), an authentication and
authorization library for securing Clojure web services and applications.

Implementing authentication and authorization for your web apps is generally a
necessary but not particularly pleasant task, even if you are using Clojure.
Friend makes it relatively easy and relatively painless, but I thought the
examples that the project's documentation demanded deserved a better forum than
to bit-rot in a markdown file or somesuch. So, what better than a bunch of live
demos of each authentication workflow that Friend supports (or is available via
another library that builds on top of Friend), with smatterings of
authorization examples here and there, all with links to the
generally-less-than-10-lines of code that makes it happen?
